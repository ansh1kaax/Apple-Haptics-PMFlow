# KPIs and Metrics
Contains two documents: a KPI Tracker and a KPI Metric Sheet with 12 detailed success indicators.
KPIs were inspired by real Apple feature rollouts (e.g., Spatial Audio), industry benchmarks, and user behavior patterns.
This folder reflects strong analytical thinking and a deep understanding of how project success is quantified in real-world PM roles.
