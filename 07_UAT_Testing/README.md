# UAT Testing
Includes a User Acceptance Testing Plan â€” drafted as a heading + scenario structure.
This is a simulated UAT setup, designed to reflect how a real team would test toggles, latency, battery, and playback sync on iPhones running Core Haptics.
Escalation paths, fail/pass criteria, and usability metrics are defined to reflect practical QA coverage even without actual users.
