# Backlogs
This folder includes the Product Backlog and Sprint Task Tracker, created in Excel.
Excel was intentionally used over Jira or Trello for simplicity, clarity, and solo simulation â€” yet follows the logic of user story creation and priority tags.
Tasks were broken down from feature-level goals into atomic, executable actions, simulating backlog grooming in a real Agile environment.
