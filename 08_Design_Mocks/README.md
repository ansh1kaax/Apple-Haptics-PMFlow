# Design Mocks
A conceptual wireframe created using Figma and Canva, showcasing a movie playback screen with haptic toggle options.
This is not a coded UI but a visual explanation of where haptics would activate and how users would control intensity and cinematic modes.
The design is iOS-themed and reflects real-world Apple UI conventions.
# User Personas
Two detailed User Persona PDFs are provided:
Aisha – 22, Bangalore-based tech-savvy viewer, curious about new immersive features
Karan – 27, daily OTT commuter viewer, interested in action/horror content during travel
These personas simulate real Indian OTT user preferences and expectations to guide design and testing priorities.
