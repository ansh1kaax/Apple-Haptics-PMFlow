This folder captures planning documents for all four sprints.
Each sprint spans 1 week, contrary to the usual 2-week industry format, to simulate a faster solo delivery timeline.
All documents are structured in clean Agile format, manually drafted and refined using tools like Word and Notion for clarity and flow.
This sprint cycle reflects real-world effort segmentation, aligning with standard Agile planning practices.
