Apple-Haptics-PMFlow
This solo project simulates the product rollout of Apple’s Core Haptics feature for enhancing user experience in action, horror, and animated media on Apple TV. Built from a project manager’s perspective, it follows a 4-sprint Agile timeline and includes structured documentation, stakeholder alignment, risk planning, KPI tracking, user persona research, and delivery roadmap.

Objective
To simulate how project managers contribute to end-to-end feature integration using Agile practices.
The focus is on Apple’s Core Haptics system and how it could improve OTT media engagement for Indian audiences.
The primary goal is to increase engagement by 30 to 50 percent and promote Apple TV usage in India.

Project Timeline (4 Sprints over 4 Weeks)
Sprint 1: Problem Statement, Project Objective and Goals, SRS Document, Stakeholder Mapping, WBS Tree

Sprint 2: Risk Identification Sheet, Wireframe Design (Figma-style), Two User Personas

Sprint 3: KPI Metrics Sheet, KPI Tracker, Sprint Backlog, UAT Plan Draft

Sprint 4: Sprint 4 Planning, Gantt Chart Roadmap, QA Checklist, README Documentation

Tools and Platforms Used
GitHub – Repository and file hosting

MS Word / Notion / Canva – Sprint plans, risk log, SRS, and persona drafts

Figma / Canva – Visual mock of Haptic UI screen

Excel / Google Sheets – KPI Tracker, Backlogs, Gantt Chart

ChatGPT – Simulated cross-functional roles like PM, QA, Designer, and Dev for realistic task ownership

Jira, MS Project, and Trello were intentionally not used due to the solo nature of the project.
However, the project structure is compatible with all standard enterprise tools and workflows.

Key Project Components
01_Project_Overview
Contains the problem statement, objective-goal breakdown, and stakeholder map.
Inspired by Apple’s F1 Haptics trailer and built to reflect Indian OTT media context.

02_Requirement_Documents
Includes SRS and WBS documents drafted in formal style. Captures feature logic, device compatibility, and work breakdown hierarchy.

03_Sprint_Planning
Four sprints are documented in Agile format. Each sprint runs one week, simulating rapid solo iteration.

04_Backlogs
Backlog and task tracker maintained in Excel. Roles and task status are updated with labels like Planning, Design, QA, and Documentation.

05_Roadmap
Gantt Chart created using Excel and Canva to visualize timeline and dependencies across all sprints.

06_KPIs_and_Metrics
Includes 12 KPIs in tracker and metric format to measure success of feature adoption, engagement uplift, feedback response, and power efficiency.

07_UAT_Testing
Simulated UAT Plan with testing flow, pass criteria, device constraints, and feedback structure. Based on toggle latency, playback sync, and intensity testing.

08_Design_Mocks
Figma-inspired wireframe of the iOS movie screen with toggle and cinematic haptics control. A conceptual screen, not a coded UI.

09_Risk_Management
Risk Identification Sheet outlines potential blockers across technical, device, execution, and testing categories. Reflects proactive PM thinking.

10_User_Personas
Two detailed personas based on real-world OTT viewer habits in India. Highlights usage patterns, genre preferences, and device behavior.

Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates how a project manager can lead feature development from idea to testing through structured planning and stakeholder simulation.
It mirrors how Agile is implemented in real product teams, using Apple’s Core Haptics as a practical use case.
It also reflects an understanding of SDLC, documentation, communication, and impact measurement even without a development background.
