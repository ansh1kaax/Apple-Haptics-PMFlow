# Risk Management
This folder includes the Risk Identification Sheet used to proactively think like a project manager during early execution.
Although no actual product code was deployed, potential risks were still considered across categories like:

Device Limitations (battery drain, latency, iOS model compatibility)

Execution Delays (due to haptic mapping across diverse movie content)

User Adoption Concerns (opt-outs, toggle usage)

Measurement & Testing Risks (no access to real iOS testing platforms)

The sheet simulates how risks are typically flagged and mitigated in cross-functional teams, including testing across devices, toggle fail-safes, and performance impact tracking.

Tools like Jira or Confluence were not used to create the risk register — instead, this was built using a visual + tabular format in Canva/Excel to ensure clarity in a solo workflow.

While simplified, this document shows strong awareness of risk-thinking — a key trait recruiters look for in entry-level project or product roles.
